# eCommerce Web App 
<p>This project was created using <strong>Java</strong>(Spring Boot, MVC & Security) and <strong>MySQL</strong> & <strong>Hibernate</strong> ORM on the back-end. </p>
<p>The front-end was written in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, using the <strong>React.js</strong> framework.</p>
